# DriveGPT
DriveGPT is an innovative AI-powered Unity simulation where a virtual car is controlled using natural language prompts or voice commands via a Large Language Model (LLM). It explores the fusion of LLM intelligence with real-time 3D environments, enabling users to "talk" to the car and watch it respond with human-like understanding.
